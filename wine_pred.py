# This prediction loop lets users keep testing without restarting the program.
# It asks for all the wine features as input, so you can try different values easily.
# Plus, you can choose between red or white wine models, making it flexible and user-friendly.
# Overall, itâ€™s designed to make experimenting with predictions simple and interactive.
